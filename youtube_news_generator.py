    Scientists have discovered a new species of deep-sea fish that can survive at extreme depths. 
    The discovery was made during an expedition to the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans.
    The fish, named Pseudoliparis swirei, can survive at depths of up to 8,000 meters below the surface.
    
    Researchers were surprised by the fish's unique adaptations, including a specialized enzyme system that allows it to function under immense pressure.
    "This discovery challenges our understanding of the limits of vertebrate life," said Dr. Jane Smith, lead researcher on the expedition.
    
    The findings, published in the journal Nature, could have implications for understanding how life might exist in extreme environments on other planets.
