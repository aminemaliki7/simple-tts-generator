I've observed     how power moves     in cycles.        The wisest minds     throughout history     have understood this.        We must confront     our past selves     before commanding     our future.

What I share     is a strategic examination     of your most dangerous opponent:        your former self,        whose shadow     still directs your choices     in ways invisible     to your conscious mind.
