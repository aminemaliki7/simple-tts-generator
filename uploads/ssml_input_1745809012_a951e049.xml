    I've observed <break time="300ms"/> how power moves <break time="300ms"/> in cycles.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    The wisest minds <break time="300ms"/> throughout history <break time="300ms"/> have understood this.

    <break time="400ms"/>
    whose shadow <break time="300ms"/> still directs your choices <break time="300ms"/> in ways invisible <break time="300ms"/> to your conscious mind.
